My name is Jorge Luis Yurivilca Peña. I am 38 years old and currently reside in Upplands Väsby, where I have been living for a while now. My mother, my brothers, and I moved to Sweden in the year 2000, and we have been living here since then.

Family is very important to me, and I love spending time with my family and my beautiful daughter. One of my hobbies is exploring new technologies and programming. I often visit this programming community on Reddit to stay updated and learn new things.

Growing up and adjusting to life in Sweden has been a journey filled with challenges and opportunities. Over the years, I have developed a deep appreciation for the diverse culture and the welcoming nature of this country. and  You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
