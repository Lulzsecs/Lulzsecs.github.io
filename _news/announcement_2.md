The Pomodoro Method is a time management technique that can help you be more productive and maintain focus. It works by dividing your work into 25-minute intervals, called "Pomodoros," followed by a short break.

How to apply it:

1.Choose a task you want to work on.
2.Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the task without interruptions.
3.When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break.
4.After 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

This method helps prevent burnout and allows you to maintain a steady focus on your tasks.
